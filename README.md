This project is a work in progress project. Its goal is to be fully working blog with the admin side for creating and updating blog posts and with the user side, where the users can read the posts and comment on them.


The front end side is written in React with the potential to be rewritten to Typescript. State is managed in Redux with the help of Redux-toolkit.

The blog posts will be posted and retrieved from a server with Axios.
